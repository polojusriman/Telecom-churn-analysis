# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using Python, data visualization, and machine learning models. The goal is to identify the factors that influence customer churn and build models to predict it accurately.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`  
It contains features such as customer demographics, subscription services, tenure, payment methods, and churn status.
